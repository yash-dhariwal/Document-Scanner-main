# Application is live : https://ocr-nu.vercel.app/

1. ## Introduction
    This application harnesses the power of React and modern web technologies to capture images through a webcam and allows users to select states from a dropdown menu. Developed with scalability and maintainability in mind, it demonstrates the effective use of React hooks, context for state management, and component-based architecture, all bundled efficiently with Vite for an enhanced development experience.

2. ## Features
    Webcam Image Capture: Utilizes the react-webcam library to capture real-time images from the user's webcam and extracts the information from the Driving Liscence and displays it on the screen.
